This project explores FoodHub's order data to uncover customer behavior and business insights. FoodHub is a food aggregator that lets customers order from multiple restaurants through one app. The dataset includes nearly 1,900 orders placed via their platform.

## Objective

- As a data scientist at FoodHub, the goal is to answer key business questions:

- Which restaurants and cuisines are in high demand?
- How long does food preparation and delivery take?
- What‚Äôs the distribution of customer ratings?
- What factors affect 5-star reviews?

- Higher ratings are loosely linked to lower-cost orders
- Preparation and delivery time don‚Äôt seem to impact ratings

## Recommendations

- **Encourage reviews**: Offer small rewards or discounts to boost customer feedback.
- **Double down on what works**: Promote top cuisines‚Äîespecially American‚Äîon weekends.
- **Staff for the surge**: Ensure more drivers and staff are available on weekends.
- **Track cost vs. satisfaction**: Keep an eye on how perceived value impacts ratings.
